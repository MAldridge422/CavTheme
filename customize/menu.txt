# This document defines what items go in the main navigation menu
# Each line is Title, Location, Target (optional)
# To make a sub-menu, use a "{" as the Location
# Put a "}" on a line after a sub-menu's items have been listed
# Lines that start with a "#" will be commented out
# To use a "#" as the first character of a Title, use &num instead
